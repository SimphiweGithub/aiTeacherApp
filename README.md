ClassCraft.AI: Empowering Educators Through AI-Driven Lesson Planning
Themes: Artificial Intelligence & Education
In an era where classroom technology continues to evolve, ClassCraft.AI emerges as a solution dedicated to streamlining one of the most time-intensive responsibilities for educators: crafting lesson plans, tests, and quizzes. By integrating the advanced capabilities of Artificial Intelligence, ClassCraft.AI automates the generation of educational materials, allowing teachers to prioritize student engagement and growth over repetitive preparation tasks.
Built with a foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and powered by the Gemini AI API, this web application provides a flexible, user-guided experience to produce tailored lesson templates, assessments, and quizzes. Notably, ClassCraft.AI emphasizes educator autonomyâ€”offering adaptable guidelines that can be customized to fit diverse curriculums and educational objectives, especially those relevant to South African standards.
With the goal of reducing preparation time and enhancing the overall learning environment, ClassCraft.AI supports educators as they navigate the dynamic classroom landscape, empowering them to unlock more time for interactive and personalized teaching experiences.

Problem: The burden of crafting engaging, and comprehensive lesson plans, tests, and quizzes often consumes valuable time educators could spend fostering student growth and interaction. These time-consuming tasks can become a barrier to effective learning experiences.

Solution: ClassCraft.AI tackles this challenge by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our web application automates the generation of lesson plans, tests, and quizzes, freeing educators to focus on what truly matters - fostering student success through personalized and interactive learning.

How it Works: ClassCraft.AI utilizes an AI integration to provide educators with an automated means to create lesson plans tailored to different timeframes (yearly, monthly, or weekly). Additionally, the application generates various tests and quizzes to assess student understanding. It's important to note that ClassCraft.AI serves as a springboard, offering educators a foundational template or guideline that can be readily customized to address specific needs and learning objectives. Educators retain full control and can easily adapt the generated materials to suit their unique teaching styles and student challenges.


Scope of Application: Powered by the advanced capabilities of the Gemini AI API, ClassCraft.AI can generate content across diverse curriculums and subjects, with a special emphasis on South African educational guidelines.

Market Relevance: Technology is steadily transforming the classroom landscape, with smart boards, projectors, and educational apps becoming commonplace tools. ClassCraft.AI seamlessly integrates into this evolving environment, offering educators a convenient and time-saving solution for a traditionally laborious task. Our software focuses on automating a recurring and often tedious aspect of lesson preparation, allowing educators to dedicate more time and energy to fostering a dynamic and engaging learning environment.

Technologies: ClassCraft.AI leverages a powerful combination of technologies, including JavaScript, Typescript, CSS, and the Google Gemini AI API. This robust architecture facilitates seamless interaction between user prompts and the AI engine, enabling the generation of high-quality educational materials.
By harnessing the power of AI, ClassCraft.AI empowers educators to streamline lesson planning, maximize their time, and ultimately, unlock greater student learning potential.

Features: Our software enables educators to generate lesson plans  based on their curriculum, subject and grade, for a term. It allows educators to generate printable quizzes to be given to learners based on their subject, grade and curriculum and it makes use of an in-app calendar to schedule their lessons from the lesson plan.

Future plans: 
Currently as it stands that software if more focused to Primary School and High school, with the AI being trained on the most recent curriculum, (Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) and Independent Examinations Board (IEB)), for a few sample grades and subject (for demonstration purposes).
To expand upon these ideas, we will implement and Administration/Overseer role, the current app only has the functionality to support individual teacher profiles and generations, in a fully built environment there will be an ability for the entire faculty of a subject to join groups. Which can be monitored by the Head of Department (HOD), to ensure consistency in the lessons planned and as well that they all adhere to the standards of the curriculum.
In terms of a business venture, should the app receive the necessary traction in order to be a fully developed app, the intention is to offer this as a Software as a Service solution, with version for Individual Educators, Entire Schools and the option of an Enterprise package, all of these can be done as a subscription-based service. With prices based on the needs and abilities of the client.
Student integration, with the management of educators being established, the ability to provide exercise and quizzes and students from inside the app is possible



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
